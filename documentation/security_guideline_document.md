# Security Guidelines for NetLabShowcase Platform

This document provides a comprehensive security guideline tailored to the `netlabshowcase-docs-platform` codebase. It aligns with core security principles and best practices to ensure a robust, secure, and maintainable Next.js application.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

- **Strong Credential Storage**
  - Use bcrypt or Argon2 with unique salts for all user passwords.  
  - Never store passwords in plaintext or weak hashes.
- **Session Management**
  - Leverage secure HTTP-only, SameSite=strict cookies for session tokens.  
  - Enforce idle timeouts (e.g., 15 minutes) and absolute timeouts per session.  
  - Rotate session identifiers on login to mitigate fixation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define explicit roles (`admin`, `instructor`, `student`) and map permissions (create, read, update, delete) per role.  
  - Implement server-side checks in each API route and Server Action to verify the current user’s role before any state-changing operation.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Provide optional MFA via time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for sensitive accounts or elevated roles.

## 2. Input Handling & Processing

- **Server-Side Input Validation**
  - Use `zod` or similar schema validators for all request bodies, query parameters, and file metadata.  
  - Reject or sanitize any unexpected fields.
- **Prevent Injection Attacks**
  - Use Drizzle ORM’s parameterized queries exclusively—avoid raw SQL.  
  - Sanitize AI prompts and user-supplied text before forwarding to external services.
- **Secure File Uploads**
  - Validate file type (MIME), extension whitelist, and maximum file size.  
  - Store files outside the webroot in private buckets (e.g., Vercel Blob, AWS S3) with per-object ACLs.  
  - Prefix filenames with UUIDs and user IDs to avoid collisions and path traversal.
- **Output Encoding**
  - Escape all user-generated content rendered in React components via default JSX escaping.  
  - Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encryption in Transit**
  - Enforce HTTPS everywhere by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS in Next.js `middleware.ts` and configuring HSTS headers.
- **Encryption at Rest**
  - Ensure the database disk, file storage buckets, and backups are encrypted (AES-256).
- **Secrets Management**
  - Do not store API keys, database URLs, or secret tokens in code or `.env` files committed to source control.  
  - Use a secrets manager (e.g., Vercel Environment Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager) injected at build/deploy time.
- **PII Handling & Data Minimization**
  - Only collect PII strictly required for platform functions.  
  - Mask or redact sensitive fields (e.g., emails) in logs and API responses when not essential.

## 4. API & Service Security

- **HTTPS & TLS Configuration**
  - Configure TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers; disable insecure versions (SSLv3, TLS <1.2).
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
  - Implement per-endpoint rate limits (e.g., max 100 requests/minute) using middleware or API gateway rules.
- **CORS Policies**
  - Restrict origins to your official domains (e.g., `https://netlabshowcase.example.com`).  
  - Allow only required methods and headers.
- **API Versioning**
  - Prefix routes with `/api/v1/…`.  
  - Maintain backwards compatibility and deprecate old versions securely.
- **Minimal Response Data**
  - Return only necessary fields in JSON responses.  
  - Avoid leaking internal IDs, file paths, or stack traces.

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

- **Security Headers**
  - Strict-Transport-Security: `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  - Content-Security-Policy: Define allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, fonts, and frame-ancestors.
  - X-Frame-Options: `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
  - X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`
  - Referrer-Policy: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **CSRF Protection**
  - Use anti-CSRF tokens (e.g., NextAuth’s built-in CSRF or `csrfTokens` package) for all state-changing Server Actions and API endpoints.
- **Secure Cookies**
  - Set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` on all authentication cookies.

## 6. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

- **Secure Defaults**
  - Disable debug logging and developer tool endpoints in production (`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`).
- **Hardened Server Images**
  - Use minimal Docker base images (e.g., `node:18-alpine`), remove unnecessary packages, and apply OS patches regularly.
- **Network Exposure**
  - Expose only port 3000 publicly; restrict database ports to private subnets or internal VPCs.
- **Automated Patch Management**
  - Integrate automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot) and schedule monthly security reviews.

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Use Lockfiles**
  - Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure deterministic installs.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**
  - Integrate SCA tools (e.g., GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) in CI to detect and fix known CVEs.
- **Minimal Footprint**
  - Audit installed npm packages; remove unused or outdated dependencies.  
  - Prefer well-maintained libraries with active security patches.

## 8. Monitoring, Auditing & Incident Response

- **Logging & Audit Trails**
  - Log authentication events, file uploads, and critical operations with structured logs (JSON).  
  - Ensure logs exclude sensitive data and are shipped to a centralized SIEM.
- **Real-Time Alerts**
  - Set alerts for repeated failed login attempts, unexpected spikes in traffic, or error rates.
- **Incident Playbook**  
  - Maintain a documented response plan covering containment, investigation, notification, and recovery.
