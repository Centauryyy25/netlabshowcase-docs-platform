# App Flow Document for NetLabShowcase

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A newcomer arrives at the NetLabShowcase landing page and sees an invitation to join or sign in. By selecting the sign-up link, the user lands on a clean form asking for an email address and a password. After filling out these fields, the user clicks a button to register. An email confirmation step may be included to verify the address. Once confirmed, the user is directed to the sign-in page. If the user already has credentials, they can go directly to the sign-in page to enter their email and password and submit the form. On successful authentication, the system sets a secure session cookie and redirects the user to the main dashboard. The sign-out option is always visible in the top navigation, logging the user out and clearing the session. If a user forgets their password, they click a “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in page, provide their registered email, and receive a reset link by email. Following that link leads them to a page where they choose a new password, and on successful reset, they return to the sign-in page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on a protected dashboard that lists all published labs in preview cards. The page header shows the user’s name and a sign-out button. A collapsible sidebar on the left displays available lab categories such as Routing, Switching, and Security. The sidebar also contains navigation links for uploading new labs, accessing the AI assistant, and going to account settings. Each lab card shows a thumbnail, title, brief description, and difficulty level. At the top of the dashboard, there is a search field and a button to filter by category. Clicking on any lab card takes the user to that lab’s detail page. The user can collapse or expand the sidebar to focus on the content area.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks the “Upload Lab” link in the sidebar, the app transitions to the upload page. This page presents a form with fields for title, description, category, difficulty level, and a file uploader for the lab topology or configuration files. The user fills in the metadata and drags or selects files from their computer. Hints appear inline to let the user know acceptable file types and sizes. On submitting the form, a server action handles file validation and storage in cloud blob storage, then records the lab metadata and file paths in the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM. Once the lab is created, the user is automatically redirected to the new lab’s detail URL.

On the lab detail page, the user sees the lab title, description, and a topology viewer that renders the uploaded image or file. Below the viewer, tabs allow switching between metadata details, configuration snippets, and the AI assistant conversation. If the user clicks the AI Assistant tab, the page smoothly scrolls to the chat interface. The chat interface shows previous messages and a prompt entry field. When the user types a question or asks for a summary, the client sends the prompt to a server action, which calls the Vercel AI SDK and returns an AI-generated response. The response appears in the chat feed, and the user can copy or save it.

If the user wants to view all their own submissions, they click the “My Labs” link in the sidebar. This reloads the dashboard with a filter applied to show only labs associated with their account. For deeper administrative control, a user with admin privileges sees an additional link in the sidebar to an admin panel where they can review, approve, or delete any lab. From each page, the user can return to the main dashboard by clicking the dashboard logo or link in the header.

## Settings and Account Management
The account settings page is accessible from the sidebar or header menu. On this page, the user sees a form populated with their current name, email, and profile picture. The user can update these fields and save changes, which triggers a server action to update the database. A separate section on the same page lets the user change their password by entering the current password, then choosing a new one. Upon successful update, a confirmation message appears. Another section allows the user to configure notification preferences, such as email alerts when someone comments on their lab or when a scheduled summary is ready. After saving preferences, the user can click a link or breadcrumb to return immediately to the dashboard or any other main feature page.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters incorrect credentials on sign-in, an inline error message informs them that the email or password is invalid, and the password field is cleared. If the password reset link has expired or is invalid, the user sees a clear message with a button to request a new reset link. On the upload page, if the user tries to upload a file that is too large or an unsupported format, a validation error message appears next to the file input, and the user can try again. During AI interactions, if the AI service fails or returns an error, a fallback message explains the failure and invites the user to retry or contact support. If the user attempts to access a lab they do not own, a “Not Authorized” page appears with a link back to the main dashboard. If the network connection drops during any operation, a banner at the top alerts the user and provides a retry button. Once connectivity is restored, the user can continue without losing entered data.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A typical user journey begins with discovering the app, signing up, and verifying their email. After signing in, they explore the dashboard, filter labs, and inspect details. When ready, they upload a new lab with associated files and metadata, then review it on the detail page. They engage the AI assistant for summaries or troubleshooting guidance and save those insights. From the dashboard, they manage their own submissions and, if needed, update their account settings or change their password. Throughout the experience, clear error messages and recovery options keep the flow smooth. Over time, the user returns to upload new labs, browse others’ work, and leverage the AI assistant to deepen their networking knowledge.
